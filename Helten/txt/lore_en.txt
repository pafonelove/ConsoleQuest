Long ago, many centuries before the events of the game "Helten", on the Obelisk of Oblivion - the pedestal of the ancient gods - clashed in
fierce battle between two gods, the brothers Lotun and Lotan. The brothers were the children of the Creator - the god Eclipsus.
Lotun was the deity of wisdom, purity of soul and strength of mind. Lotan, being completely opposite in his philosophy,
was the deity of rock, chaos and war.

The Creator had 6 children: Lotun, the god of wisdom, Lotan, the god of chaos, Aquania, the goddess of water, Ignisor, the god of fire,
Erath, god of the air and Terra, goddess of the earth.
While Eclipsus kept the universe in balance, the children kept the union and each balanced their own forces,
creating the world of Eternia.

/// PAGE 2 ///
Over time, Lotan's obsession with destroying Eternia got the better of him. The god of chaos stuck lightning
dagger "Sik-Tu'li" in the back of the Creator, his father. From the wound on the back of Eclipsus, with a thunderous explosion, it shot up into
heaven violet energy - Heart of Eternity. Lotun realized that the slaughter had to be stopped.

The only way was to kill the god of chaos. Lotun, with a roar of a lion, pounced on his brother, pushing him into
energy pillar of the Heart of Eternity.
Lotan's body began to decompose into atoms due to the very strong energy of the Heart. The last words of the god of chaos were
next: "We'll meet again, brother!"
Due to the connection of the energy of the Heart and the soul of Lotan, dark as the underworld itself, the column of energy changed its color to
bright scarlet. Thunder broke out around the Obelisk, lightning hitting the Maker's throne.

Lothun and his siblings saw the Heart Field begin to destroy the Obelisk of Oblivion. If this happens then
Eternia will be destroyed by the Wrath of the Most High - an apocalypse that predicts a dark prophecy.
The surviving children of the Creator sealed themselves and entered the dimension of the Heart of Eternity to close forever
a stream of energy that destroys the Obelisk of Oblivion. The souls of the gods held back the breakthrough of dark energy into Eternia.

The beginning of the apocalypse was averted. On the site of a huge crater, which was formed from the energy field of the Heart,
remained in the air, bypassing gravity, a scarlet ball, inside which one can see the silhouette of five people, tightly
squeezing something round, similar to a medal - this is the Seal of Balance in the hands of the children of the Creator of Eternia ...

During the 9th century, the Tiu-Dal'ov era - ancient creatures that, according to the description of the annals, looked like humanoid
humanoids 3 meters high - there was an empire of Kudurs, guardians of the Sphere of Eternity.
Emperor Kudur III, nicknamed the Invincible, was a powerful ruler in the Flycon continent. He was
the third in the family, whose hands guarded the Sphere as their blood heirs.

In the parallel world of Endrol, the evil lord Licht plotted to destroy the Sphere of Eternity in order to invade with his
army to Eternia and take control of the world of people, releasing the power of Lotan, the god of chaos, out.
On one calm day, in front of the city of Uwiy, the citadel of Emperor Kudur III, under the peals of thunder and bright lightning,
a huge gate radiating an ominous red color - the invasion of Licht's army has begun.

Horns and horns sounded in Uvia, bells rang. The infantry garrison of the emperor's army lined up in a ground-shaking march
before the gates of the world of Endrol. The walls of the citadel were filled with archers and crossbowmen, engineers erected anti-siege buildings,
trebuchets, catapults and ballistas were taken out. The emperor went out with his retinue to a huge marble platform,
which towered over Uviom.

/// PAGE 5 ///
From the gates of Endrol came 10 people, dressed in armor as dark as the void itself, spewing blue flames. Leading the group
there was a person who radiated a strange aura of death - Lord Licht.

A conversation began between the two strongest rulers. Licht immediately made it clear that he intended to forcefully take control of
The Sphere of Eternity, no matter how many sacrifices it would cost. Kudur III took a blood oath to protect the artifact at the cost of his life.
The emperor showed Licht a gesture that determined the further course of events.

With a wild roar, the Horde of Darkness, the army of Lord Licht, broke out into the world of people from the gates of Endrol. A battle ensued
between the strongest civilizations of Eternia.
The battle lasted several hours. Not a single survivor on either side, except for the rulers themselves. The fight has gone all the way
throne room of the emperor. Directly behind the throne was the Sphere of Eternity. One step separated Lord Licht from the beginning of the irreversible.

Bleeding, covered in cuts, Kudur III came face to face with his enemy. The wounded lord Licht rushed at the emperor,
plunging his blade straight into the heart of the latter. From the last strength, spitting blood from his mouth,
Kudur III said: "Tiu-Niz', where are you?!"

Suddenly, a crystal-clear diamond-shaped stone was formed behind the back of the lord of evil, jubilant from the victory, from which
humanoid three meters tall. It was Tiu-Niz' - the last Master of Knowledge of the Tiu-Dal'ov race.

Licht jumped up, pulling the blade out of Kudur III's heart, and ran towards the Sphere of Eternity. The lord of evil dealt a devastating
blow with the edge of the blade right in the center of the sphere. At the same moment Tiu-Niz' waved the Staff of Time,
crying out: "Stop, child of darkness! You do not know what consequences our worlds will suffer!".

/// PAGE 7 ///
Time stopped. The sphere hung, splitting into 6 pieces. The Master of Knowledge touched Licht with the index fingers of both hands.
and Kyuduru III. In the blink of an eye, both bodies vanished into oblivion.
Tiu-Niz' swung his staff again, collecting six shards of the Orb of Eternity in his gigantic hand.

The battle is over. The gates of Endrol sucked in the warriors of darkness, then slammed shut. Thunder over Uviy cleared, the sun rose,
clouds disappeared from the horizon, only the bodies of the fallen defenders of the citadel remained lying on the ground...

...The convening of the Council of Eternia's Rulers has begun. At the foot of the Obelisk of Oblivion, the rulers of different kingdoms
gathered at a monolithic table world Eternia: the kingdoms of Leon le Grande (humans), Midarius (elves), Dun-Gvagog' (orcs),
Quigblick (goblins), Aqua-Terron (amphibians), Endrol (children of Darkness).

At the head of the table sat a humanoid of the ancient race of three meters in height.
The Master of Knowledge handed over one fragment of the Sphere of Eternity to each of the rulers of his kingdom. The fragments contained souls
children of the Creator. Accordingly, the elements that are the basis of the universe of Eternia are sealed in these fragments.

By the decision of the Council, the Elves were instructed to become the guardians of the Crystal of Chaos - the soul of Lotan -
for since ancient times, elven magicians were able to keep the forces of Darkness locked up.
Humans got the Crystal of Wisdom, Elves got the Crystal of Chaos, Orcs got the Crystal of Ignisor, Goblins got the
Crystal of Erath, Amphibians got the Crystal Aquania, children of the Darkness - Terra Crystal.

Having sworn to keep the crystals as the apple of their eye, the rulers of the races of Eternia entered into a general neutrality. Peace has come to Eternia.

The 4th era of the reign of the Lonshadars in the dungeons of the capital of the kingdom of the elves, the city of Teldras-o-gaile, a
cult of followers was formed Lotan, god of chaos. The community of fanatics has nicknamed itself the "Righteous Path".
The leader of the sect, Reverend Nyadar, tasked his bodyguard, the assassin Shalib Ying'Aktar, to obtain the Chaos Crystal 
at any cost in order to break the Seal of Equilibrium and release the soul of the Dark Son of the Creator.

One winter night, an assassin entered the chambers of the Elven king Dostar-Tillas through the balcony, killing the guards with poison arrows.
Shalib In' Aktar. The killer was fast and professionally dangerous. Dostar-Tillas did not have time to understand what was happening, when he suddenly felt
piercing pain, followed by a cold inside the heart.

The assassin plunged a dagger into the body of the elf king as he lay in bed. Shalib In' Aktar went to the altar where he was

The guards raised the alarm 30 minutes after the assassination of the king. They failed to find traces of the one who deprived the elves of the ruler.

A year has passed since the assassination of the Elven King Dostar-Tillas and the theft of the Crystal of Chaos. In the shelter of the
"Righteous Path" Reverend Niadar prepares for a dark ritual to free the soul of the god of chaos from the Crystal that holds back the power of Darkness.

Meanwhile, the ruler of Leon le Grande, the king of the human race Gottfried V, organizes a meeting of the rulers of Eternia to prepare an army
in order to resist the invasion of the forces of Darkness after the release of the soul of Lotan.

The meeting took place in the city of Nelbourne in the kingdom of Leon le Grande. Humans, elves, orcs and goblins have made an alliance - the Union of Light - on
during the war and allocated numerous troops to form an army. Warlords began to expect the coming of the Army of Darkness...

The rite of liberation of Lotan, the god of chaos, has begun. At the Sanctuary of the Righteous Path, Reverend Niadar delivered a ritual speech in ancient
the language of the dark gods, touched the crystal, as at the same moment the room was lit up with a bright red light.

Niadar roared in pain, comparable to skinning the body of a living person. The world within the Reverend was plunged into darkness. Seems,
his heart stopped, but suddenly he heard the real voice of the devil inside his head - Lotan himself spoke to him.

The body of Niadar became a vessel for the soul of the god of chaos - he was embodied in human form. Taking the crystal in his hand, Lotan crushed it.
powerful clenched fist. From the altar in the underground sanctuary of the "Righteous Path", a red column of energy rushed into the sky - distorted
the power of the Heart of Eternity, - destroying the entire earthly surface and part of the buildings of the capital of the kingdom of the Elves.

In the central square of the capital of the kingdom of elves, a huge portal to the Void World has opened - another parallel dimension of Eternia.
Warriors of Darkness poured out of the portal in hordes. The prophecy has come true - the apocalypse has begun.

Clouds gathered along the entire border of the kingdom of people, the sky became gloomy and eerily scarlet. Lightning flashed under the thunder.
The Army of the Union of Light formed a long wall to meet the enemy.
A horn of horns was heard on the horizon - the sentinels of King Gottfried V saw the henchmen marching with a victorious tread
Niadara-Lotana, who came from the Netherworld.

As soon as the lord of people gave the command to attack the enemy, a large army rushed in a kilometer wave towards the army of dark creatures.
The decisive battle began - the battle of Light and Darkness.
